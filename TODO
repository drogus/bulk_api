* allow to inherit for Bulk::Resource directly
* fix setting resource_name (it sets the name, but Bulk::Resource will look for a class based on a resource class name anyway)
* refactor handling responses
* do not always fetch all the records
* * timestamps seems reasonable way to check for newest records
* * should be configurable for individual classes
* think about handling queries:
* * how to handle simple queries
* * how can developers extend it to use complex queries
